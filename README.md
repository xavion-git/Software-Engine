Building a rendering engine from the ground up in JavaScript. Implements a software rasterizer that handles triangle setup, texture mapping, and depth buffering without WebGL. A deep dive into the fundamentals of computer graphics.

## Why Build this 

I'm deeply interested in constructing 3D objects through mathematical principles, which I believe offers an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of computer graphics fundamentals.

- In addition to being super informational I want to deepend my understanding of Javascript fundamentals 

## End Result

This is the end-goal of this project
